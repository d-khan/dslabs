# Linear and binary search

## Objective
Understand the working of linear and binary search algorithms

## Pre-requisite
Review "Searching and Big O Notations" from the book [Data Structures in C++](https://d-khan.github.io/ds)

## Task
1. How many steps would it take to perform a linear search for the number 8 in the ordered array, [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 13]? - **1 pt**
2. How many steps would binary search take for the previous example? - **1 pt**
3. What is the maximum number of steps it would take to perform a binary search on an array of size 100,000? - **1 pt**
4. Write a C++ code that implements the linear and binary search algorithms. The algorithm should be able to calculate the number of steps against the given search. - **7 pts**

## What to submit?  
- All the explanation are saved as .txt format and upload in Canvas.
- Code related responses are saved as .cpp and upload in Canvas.
- Create a video that explains the working of the code and your explanations. Furthermore, the video should show your face on one side of the screen (preferably the top or bottom right of the screen). 

## How to submit it?
- Upload your work in Canvas. Remember .txt file formats are for narative based responses and .cpp is for C++ code. Clearly define task numbers.  

## Deadline
The deadlines are posted on the Syllabus as well as on Canvas.

## Rubric
- The video describes the code in detail. The code is working as per instruction, and the explanations of the questions are submitted (10 marks).  
- The video is submitted, and the code is working, but a partial explanation of the questions is submitted. (7+ marks).  
- The code is uploaded but not working regardless the video is submitted or not. (0 marks)
