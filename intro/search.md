# Linear and binary search

## Objective
Understand the working of linear and binary search algorithms

## Pre-requisite
Review "Searching and Big O Notations" from the book [Data Structures in C++](https://d-khan.github.io/ds)

## Task
1. How many steps would it take to perform a linear search for the number 8 in the ordered array, [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 13]? - **1 pt**
2. How many steps would binary search take for the previous example? - **1 pt**
3. What is the maximum number of steps it would take to perform a binary search on an array of size 100,000? - **1 pt**
4. Write a C++ code that implements the linear and binary search algorithms. The algorithm should be able to calculate the number of steps against the given search. - **7 pts**

## What/how to submit?  
- Write your responses in a markdown file along with the code, upload the file to GitHub, and submit the GitHub link in Canvas. Use **appropriate headings to differentiate tasks**. Please review the guide “[Submitting Your Assignment Using GitHub](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjY-L71A9PE)” before submission.
- Create a video explaining the functionality of your code along with your explanations. The video should also display your face on one side of the screen, preferably in the top-right or bottom-right corner. 

## Deadline
The deadlines are posted on the Syllabus as well as on Canvas.

## Rubric
- The video describes the code in detail. The code is working as per instruction, and the explanations of the questions are submitted (10 marks).  
- The video is submitted, and the code is working, but a partial explanation of the questions is submitted. (7+ marks).  
- The code is uploaded but not working regardless the video is submitted or not. (0 marks)
