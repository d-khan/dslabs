# Hash tables

## Objective
Understand the working of hash tables

## Pre-requisite
Review "Hash Tables" from the book [Data Structures in C++](https://d-khan.github.io/ds)

## Task
1. Assume you have a simple single-dimensional array

```array = [200, 400, 100, 50, 350]```

Linear search will take $O(N)$. Write a code in C++/Python to improve the search operation efficiency from $O(N)$ to $O(1)$. **4 pts **

2. Use C++, generate hash value of your name. **1 pts**

3. With the help of a figure, explain the problem that occured due to introducing a __tombstone__ to mark the deleted cell. **5 pts**

## What/how to submit?  
- Write your responses in a markdown file along with the code, upload the file to GitHub, and submit the GitHub link in Canvas. Use **appropriate headings to differentiate tasks**. Please review the guide “[Submitting Your Assignment Using GitHub](https://sdccd-edu.zoom.us/rec/play/SVjSkOJp16n_7ii-oRt1-9auud9NZ0NrhuXrnJYf-bcQP5ipZbGONd6Jxt7h1jns5OJKIq9lgjAuBw.Tc2b6f-qrSDM8aye?eagerLoadZvaPages=sidemenu.billing.plan_management&accessLevel=meeting&canPlayFromShare=true&from=share_recording_detail&startTime=1725121532000&componentName=rec-play&originRequestUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fsdccd-edu.zoom.us%2Frec%2Fshare%2FSVvlngcEn-7CaNI8FvwEVJ5ulLp4sxpqN9hnCYvXeHHcls2e0TBlU47uATNklUf-.yX4fsJjsU2nuLGeX%3FstartTime%3D1725121532000)” before submission.
- Create a video explaining the functionality of your code along with your explanations. The video should also display your face on one side of the screen, preferably in the top-right or bottom-right corner. 

## Deadline
The deadlines are posted on the Syllabus as well as on Canvas.

## Rubric
- The video describes the solution in detail. (10 marks).  
- The video is submitted, but the questions are partially explained. (Marks based on what you have submitted).  
- The video is not submitted, regardless of whether the solutions are submitted. (0 marks)
