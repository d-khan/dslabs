# Hash tables

## Objective
Understand the working of hash tables

## Pre-requisite
Review "Hash Tables" from the book [Data Structures in C++](https://d-khan.github.io/ds)

## Task
1. Assume you have a simple single-dimensional array

```array = [200, 400, 100, 50, 350]```

Linear search will take $O(N)$. Write a code in C++/Python to improve the search operation efficiency from $O(N)$ to $O(1)$. **4 pts **

2. Use C++, generate hash value of your name. **1 pts**

3. With the help of a figure, explain the problem that occured due to introducing a __tombstone__ to mark the deleted cell. **5 pts**


## What to submit?  

- All the explanations are saved in .txt format and uploaded in Canvas.
- Create a video that explains your solution. Furthermore, the video should show your face on one side of the screen (preferably the top or bottom right of the screen). 

## How to submit it?
- Upload your work in Canvas. Remember .txt file formats are for narrative-based responses, and .cpp is for C++ code. Clearly define task numbers. __Do not compress files. Do not zip. Use mp4 format for the videos__

## Deadline
The deadlines are posted on the Syllabus as well as on Canvas.

## Rubric
- The video describes the solution in detail. (10 marks).  
- The video is submitted, but the questions are partially explained. (Marks based on what you have submitted).  
- The video is not submitted, regardless of whether the solutions are submitted. (0 marks)
