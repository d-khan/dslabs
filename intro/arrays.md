# Array data structure

## Objective
Understand how array data structures are defined in C++

## Pre-requisite
Review "Why learn structures" from the book [Data Structures in C++](https://d-khan.github.io/ds)

## Task
1. Explain how to create an array of 100 elements. You can choose any data type of your choice. (requires C++ code) - **1 pts**
2. What will be the size of each element of an array. (requires C++ code) - **1 pts**
3. For an array containing 100 elements, provide the number of steps the following operations would take: (theoretical) - **6 pts**
- Reading
- Searching for a value not contained within the array
- Insertion at the beginning of the array
- Insertion at the end of the array
- Deletion at the beginning of the array
- Deletion at the end of the array
4. Normally the search operation in an array looks for the first instance of a given value. But sometimes we may want to look for every instance of a given value. For example, say we want to count how many times the value “apple” is found inside an array. How many steps would it take to find all the “apples”? Give your answer in terms of N. (theoretical) - **1 pts**
5. Research how to find the memory address of an array. You can use any programming language of your choice. (requires code) **1 pts**

## What/how to submit?  
- Write your responses in a markdown file along with the code, upload the file to GitHub, and submit the GitHub link in Canvas. Use **appropriate headings to differentiate tasks**. Please review the guide “[Submitting Your Assignment Using GitHub](https://sdccd-edu.zoom.us/rec/play/SVjSkOJp16n_7ii-oRt1-9auud9NZ0NrhuXrnJYf-bcQP5ipZbGONd6Jxt7h1jns5OJKIq9lgjAuBw.Tc2b6f-qrSDM8aye?eagerLoadZvaPages=sidemenu.billing.plan_management&accessLevel=meeting&canPlayFromShare=true&from=share_recording_detail&startTime=1725121532000&componentName=rec-play&originRequestUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fsdccd-edu.zoom.us%2Frec%2Fshare%2FSVvlngcEn-7CaNI8FvwEVJ5ulLp4sxpqN9hnCYvXeHHcls2e0TBlU47uATNklUf-.yX4fsJjsU2nuLGeX%3FstartTime%3D1725121532000)” before submission.
- Create a video explaining the functionality of your code along with your explanations. The video should also display your face on one side of the screen, preferably in the top-right or bottom-right corner. 


## Deadline
The deadlines are posted on the Syllabus as well as on Canvas.

## Rubric
- The video describes the code in detail. The code is working as per instruction, and the explanations of the questions are submitted (10 marks).  
- The video is submitted, and the code is working, but a partial explanation of the questions is submitted. (6+ marks).  
- The code is uploaded but not working regardless the video is submitted or not. (0 marks)
