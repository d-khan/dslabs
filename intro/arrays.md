# Array data structure

## Objective
Understand how array data structures are defined in C++

## Pre-requisite
Review "Why learn structures" from the book [Data Structures in C++](https://d-khan.github.io/ds)

## Task
1. Explain how to create an array of 100 elements. You can choose any data type of your choice. (requires C++ code) - **1 pts**
2. What will be the size of each element of an array. (requires C++ code) - **1 pts**
3. For an array containing 100 elements, provide the number of steps the following operations would take: (theoretical) - **6 pts**
- Reading
- Searching for a value not contained within the array
- Insertion at the beginning of the array
- Insertion at the end of the array
- Deletion at the beginning of the array
- Deletion at the end of the array
4. Normally the search operation in an array looks for the first instance of a given value. But sometimes we may want to look for every instance of a given value. For example, say we want to count how many times the value “apple” is found inside an array. How many steps would it take to find all the “apples”? Give your answer in terms of N. (theoretical) - **1 pts**
5. Research how to find the memory address of an array. You can use any programming language of your choice. (requires code) **1 pts**

## What to submit?  
- All the explanation are saved as .txt format and upload in Canvas.
- Code related responses are saved as .cpp and upload in Canvas.
- Create a video that explains the working of the code and your explanations. Furthermore, the video should show your face on one side of the screen (preferably the top or bottom right of the screen). 

## How to submit it?
- Upload your work in Canvas. Remember .txt file formats are for narative based responses and .cpp is for C++ code. Clearly define task numbers.  

## Deadline
The deadlines are posted on the Syllabus as well as on Canvas.

## Rubric
- The video describes the code in detail. The code is working as per instruction, and the explanations of the questions are submitted (10 marks).  
- The video is submitted, and the code is working, but a partial explanation of the questions is submitted. (6+ marks).  
- The code is uploaded but not working regardless the video is submitted or not. (0 marks)
