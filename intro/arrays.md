# Array data structure

## Objective
Understand how array data structures are defined in C++

## Pre-requisite
Review "Why learn structures" from the book [Data Structures in C++](https://d-khan.github.io/ds)

## Task
1. Explain how to create an array of 100 elements. You can choose any data type of your choice.  
2. What will be the size of each element of an array
3. For an array containing 100 elements, provide the number of steps the following operations would take:
  - Reading
  - Searching for a value not contained within the array
  - Insertion at the beginning of the array
  - Insertion at the end of the array
  - Deletion at the beginning of the array
  - Deletion at the end of the array

## What to submit?
1. Draw a flowchart of your thought process. I found this [online flowchart website](http://www.draw.io) very useful. However, you can use any application of your choice. (2 marks).   
2. What were your challenges in performing the lab (from design to the implementation phases)? (2 mark).  
3. Create a video that explains the working of the code. Furthermore, the video should show your face on one side of the screen (preferably the top or bottom right of the screen). Also, submit the code in the .java extension. (6 marks)

## How to submit it?
- Upload your work in the .pdf format and clearly define your responses.  
- Use headings when possible. Upload the code in the .java extension.

## Deadline
The deadlines are posted on the Syllabus as well as on Canvas.

## Rubric
- The video describes the code in detail. The code is working as per instruction, and the explanation of the questions is submitted (10 marks).  
- The video is submitted, and the code is working, but a partial explanation of the questions is submitted. (6+ marks).  
- The code is uploaded but not working regardless the video is submitted or not. (0 marks)
