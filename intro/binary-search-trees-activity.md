# Binary Search Trees

## Objective
Implement binary search trees data structures

## Pre-requisite
Review [Binary Search Trees](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/d-khan/dslabs/blob/main/binary-search-trees/Binary%20search%20trees.html)

## Task
1. Imagine you were to take an empty binary search tree and insert the following sequence of numbers in this order: [1, 5, 9, 2, 4, 10, 6, 3, 8]. Draw a diagram showing what the binary search tree would look like. Remember, the numbers are being inserted in the order presented here. **(2 points)**
2. If a well-balanced binary search tree contains 1,000 values, what is the maximum number of steps it would take to search for a value within it? **(1 point)**
3. Write an algorithm that finds the greatest value within a binary search tree. **2 points)**
4. Write a code in C++ using the same array mentioned in #1 and implement a binary search tree. Only insertion operation is required. **(5 points)**


## What to submit?  

- All the explanations are saved in .txt format and uploaded in Canvas.
- Create a video that explains your solution. Furthermore, the video should show your face on one side of the screen (preferably the top or bottom right of the screen). 

## How to submit it?
- Upload your work in Canvas. Remember .txt file formats are for narrative-based responses, and .cpp is for C++ code. Clearly define task numbers. __Do not compress files. Do not zip. Use mp4 format for the videos__

## Deadline
The deadlines are posted on the Syllabus as well as on Canvas.

## Rubric
- The video describes the solution in detail. (10 marks).  
- The video is submitted, but the questions are partially explained. (Marks based on what you have submitted).  
- The video is not submitted, regardless of whether the solutions are submitted. (0 marks)
