# Binary Search Trees

## Objective
Implement binary search trees data structures

## Pre-requisite
Review [Binary Search Trees](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/d-khan/dslabs/blob/main/binary-search-trees/Binary%20search%20trees.html)

## Task
1. Imagine you were to take an empty binary search tree and insert the following sequence of numbers in this order: [1, 5, 9, 2, 4, 10, 6, 3, 8]. Draw a diagram showing what the binary search tree would look like. Remember, the numbers are being inserted in the order presented here. **(2 points)**
2. If a well-balanced binary search tree contains 1,000 values, what is the maximum number of steps it would take to search for a value within it? **(1 point)**
3. Write an algorithm that finds the greatest value within a binary search tree. **2 points)**
4. Write a code in C++ using the same array mentioned in #1 and implement a binary search tree. Only insertion operation is required. **(5 points)**

## What/how to submit?  
- Write your responses in a markdown file along with the code, upload the file to GitHub, and submit the GitHub link in Canvas. Use **appropriate headings to differentiate tasks**. Please review the guide “[Submitting Your Assignment Using GitHub](https://sdccd-edu.zoom.us/rec/play/SVjSkOJp16n_7ii-oRt1-9auud9NZ0NrhuXrnJYf-bcQP5ipZbGONd6Jxt7h1jns5OJKIq9lgjAuBw.Tc2b6f-qrSDM8aye?eagerLoadZvaPages=sidemenu.billing.plan_management&accessLevel=meeting&canPlayFromShare=true&from=share_recording_detail&startTime=1725121532000&componentName=rec-play&originRequestUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fsdccd-edu.zoom.us%2Frec%2Fshare%2FSVvlngcEn-7CaNI8FvwEVJ5ulLp4sxpqN9hnCYvXeHHcls2e0TBlU47uATNklUf-.yX4fsJjsU2nuLGeX%3FstartTime%3D1725121532000)” before submission.
- Create a video explaining the functionality of your code along with your explanations. The video should also display your face on one side of the screen, preferably in the top-right or bottom-right corner. 

## Deadline
The deadlines are posted on the Syllabus as well as on Canvas.

## Rubric
- The video describes the solution in detail. (10 marks).  
- The video is submitted, but the questions are partially explained. (Marks based on what you have submitted).  
- The video is not submitted, regardless of whether the solutions are submitted. (0 marks)
