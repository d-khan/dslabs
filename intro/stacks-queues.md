# Stacks and queues

## Objective
Implement stacks and queues data structures

## Pre-requisite
Review "Stacks and Queues" from the book [Data Structures in C++](https://d-khan.github.io/ds)

## Task
1. Using Figure 17 as a model, in the book [Data Structures in C++](https://d-khan.github.io/ds), illustrate the result of each operation in the sequence PUSH(S,4), PUSH(S,1), PUSH(S,3), POP(S), PUSH(S,8), and POP(S) on an initially empty stack $S$ stored in array $S[1..6]$. ***Code is not required.*** **3 pts** 

2. Using Figure 18 as a model, in the book [Data Structures in C++](https://d-khan.github.io/ds), illustrate the result of each operation in the sequence ENQUEUE(Q,4), ENQUEUE(Q,1), ENQUEUE(Q,3), DEQUEUE(Q), ENQUEUE(Q,8), and DEQUEUE(Q) on an initially empty queue $Q$ stored in array $Q[1..6]$. ***Code is not required.*** **3 pts**

3. Rewrite ENQUEUE and DEQUEUE to detect ***underflow*** and ***overflow*** of a queue. (see Listings 4 & 5 in the book). ***Code is not required.*** **1 pt**

4. A stack allows insertion and deletion of elements at only end, and a queue allows insertion at one end and deletion at the other end, a **deque** (double-ended queue) allows insertion and deletion at both ends. Write four $O(1)$-time procedures to insert elements into and delete elements from both ends of a deque implemented by an array. ***Code is not required.*** **3 pts**

## What/how to submit?  
- Write your responses in a markdown file along with the code, upload the file to GitHub, and submit the GitHub link in Canvas. Use **appropriate headings to differentiate tasks**. Please review the guide “[Submitting Your Assignment Using GitHub](https://sdccd-edu.zoom.us/rec/play/SVjSkOJp16n_7ii-oRt1-9auud9NZ0NrhuXrnJYf-bcQP5ipZbGONd6Jxt7h1jns5OJKIq9lgjAuBw.Tc2b6f-qrSDM8aye?eagerLoadZvaPages=sidemenu.billing.plan_management&accessLevel=meeting&canPlayFromShare=true&from=share_recording_detail&startTime=1725121532000&componentName=rec-play&originRequestUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fsdccd-edu.zoom.us%2Frec%2Fshare%2FSVvlngcEn-7CaNI8FvwEVJ5ulLp4sxpqN9hnCYvXeHHcls2e0TBlU47uATNklUf-.yX4fsJjsU2nuLGeX%3FstartTime%3D1725121532000)” before submission.
- Create a video explaining the functionality of your code along with your explanations. The video should also display your face on one side of the screen, preferably in the top-right or bottom-right corner. 

## Deadline
The deadlines are posted on the Syllabus as well as on Canvas.

## Rubric
- The video describes the solution in detail. (10 marks).  
- The video is submitted, but the questions are partially explained. (Marks based on what you have submitted).  
- The video is not submitted, regardless of whether the solutions are submitted. (0 marks)
