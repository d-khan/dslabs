# Graphs

## Objective
Understanding Dijkstra's algorithm

## Pre-requisite
Review [Graphs](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/d-khan/dslabs/blob/main/graphs/Lecture.html) lecture.

## Tasks
1. Explain with the help of an example __"Why Dijkstra's algorithm fails on negative weights"__.

## What to submit?  
- Save the explanation in .txt format and upload it in Canvas.
- Create a video that explains your solution. Furthermore, the video should show your face on one side of the screen (preferably the top or bottom right of the screen). 

## How to submit it?
- Upload your work in Canvas. Remember .txt file formats are for narrative-based responses, and .cpp is for C++ code. Clearly define task numbers. __Do not compress files. Do not zip. Use mp4 format for the videos__

## Deadline
The deadlines are posted on the Syllabus as well as on Canvas.

## Rubric
- The video describes the solution in detail. (10 marks).  
- The video is submitted, but the questions are partially explained. (Marks based on what you have submitted).  
- The video is not submitted, regardless of whether the solutions are submitted. (0 marks)
