# Syllabus (CISC-187 Data Structures in C++) Honors Contract

## Welcome to the course!
My name is Dr. Danish Khan, and I am excited to begin this educational journey with all of you! Together, we will create a supportive and inclusive environment where everyone’s ideas are valued and respected. Your active participation will enrich our learning community, and I look forward to getting to know each of you. Let’s make this school year a meaningful experience filled with growth, learning, and lasting positive memories!

## Course description

This course is about learning data structures and their implementation. The emphasis is placed on implementing basic data structures such as stacks, heaps, queues, lists, linked lists, arrays, trees, hash tables, sorting, searching, etc., using C++ programming language. This course is designed for students majoring in computer information systems and computer science professionals who want to update their programming skills.

Students enrolled in the Honors Contract are expected to engage in independent research, complete additional assignments, and participate in one-on-one online meetings with the professor. They will also take part in Work-Based Learning activities, which include connecting with career services, enhancing resume writing and interview skills, and networking with professionals in their field of study.

You can find more information about the Honors Contract [here](https://sdmiramar.edu/services/honors).
