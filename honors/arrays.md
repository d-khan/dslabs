The manager plans to run an advertising campaign for the products offered by the company. The manager wants to know which consecutive months contribute towards the highest sales so that the advertisement can be targeted on months before and after the successive months of the highest sales. Based on the dataset, you have the following tasks:

a. Explain how you are going to solve the problem mentioned above. No coding or pseudocode is needed in this step.  
b. Implement the solution that you proposed in part a. Furthermore, the implemented solution should be able to identify consecutive months when the sales are at the highest when a different dataset is used.   
c. Write the pseudocode and explain the algorithm in terms of O(N) notation.
d. What are the limitations of the solution you proposed in part a.  



## Submission?  

- All the explanations are saved in .txt format and uploaded in Canvas.
- Create a video that explains your solution. Furthermore, the video should show your face on one side of the screen (preferably the top or bottom right of the screen). 

## How to submit it?
- Upload your work in Canvas. Remember .txt file formats are for narrative-based responses, and .cpp is for C++ code. Clearly define task numbers. __Do not compress files. Do not zip. Use mp4 format for the videos__

## Deadline
The deadlines are posted on the Syllabus as well as on Canvas.

## Rubric
- The video describes the solution in detail. (10 marks).
