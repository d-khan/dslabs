# Linked lists

## Objective
Implement linked lists data structures in C++

## Pre-requisite
Review "Linked lists" from the book [Data Structures in C++](https://d-khan.github.io/ds)

## Task
1. Using Figure 17 as a model, in the book [Data Structures in C++](https://d-khan.github.io/ds), illustrate the result of each operation in the sequence PUSH(S,4), PUSH(S,1), PUSH(S,3), POP(S), PUSH(S,8), and POP(S) on an initially empty stack $S$ stored in array $S[1..6]$. ***Code is not required.*** **3 pts** 

2. Using Figure 18 as a model, in the book [Data Structures in C++](https://d-khan.github.io/ds), illustrate the result of each operation in the sequence ENQUEUE(Q,4), ENQUEUE(Q,1), ENQUEUE(Q,3), DEQUEUE(Q), ENQUEUE(Q,8), and DEQUEUE(Q) on an initially empty queue $Q$ stored in array $Q[1..6]$. ***Code is not required.*** **3 pts**

3. Rewrite ENQUEUE and DEQUEUE to detect ***underflow*** and ***overflow*** of a queue. (see Listings 4 & 5 in the book). ***Code is not required.*** **1 pt**

4. A stack allows insertion and deletion of elements at only end, and a queue allows insertion at one end and deletion at the other end, a **deque** (double-ended queue) allows insertion and deletion at both ends. Write four $O(1)$-time procedures to insert elements into and delete elements from both ends of a deque implemented by an array. ***Code is not required.*** **3 pts**


## What to submit?  

- All the explanations are saved in .txt format and uploaded in Canvas.
- Create a video that explains your solution. Furthermore, the video should show your face on one side of the screen (preferably the top or bottom right of the screen). 

## How to submit it?
- Upload your work in Canvas. Remember .txt file formats are for narrative-based responses, and .cpp is for C++ code. Clearly define task numbers. __Do not compress files. Do not zip. Use mp4 format for the videos__

## Deadline
The deadlines are posted on the Syllabus as well as on Canvas.

## Rubric
- The video describes the solution in detail. (10 marks).  
- The video is submitted, but the questions are partially explained. (Marks based on what you have submitted).  
- The video is not submitted, regardless of whether the solutions are submitted. (0 marks)
