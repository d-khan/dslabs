# Recursions

## Objective
Implement recursions in C++

## Pre-requisite
Review [Recursions](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/d-khan/dslabs/blob/main/Recursions/Lecture.html) lecture.

## Tasks
1. The following function prints every other number from a low number to a high number. For example, if low is 0 and high is 10, it would print:
```
0
2
4
6
8
10
```
Identify the base case in the function:
```
def print_every_other(low, high) 
    return if low > high
    puts low
    print_every_other(low + 2, high)
end
```


## What to submit?  

- All the explanations are saved in .txt format and uploaded in Canvas.
- Create a video that explains your solution. Furthermore, the video should show your face on one side of the screen (preferably the top or bottom right of the screen). 

## How to submit it?
- Upload your work in Canvas. Remember .txt file formats are for narrative-based responses, and .cpp is for C++ code. Clearly define task numbers. __Do not compress files. Do not zip. Use mp4 format for the videos__

## Deadline
The deadlines are posted on the Syllabus as well as on Canvas.

## Rubric
- The video describes the solution in detail. (10 marks).  
- The video is submitted, but the questions are partially explained. (Marks based on what you have submitted).  
- The video is not submitted, regardless of whether the solutions are submitted. (0 marks)
