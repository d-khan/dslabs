# Syllabus (CISC-187 Data Structures in C++)

## Course description

This course is about learning data structures and their implementation. The emphasis is placed on implementing basic data structures such as stacks, heaps, queues, lists, linked lists, arrays, trees, hash tables, sorting, searching, etc., using C++ programming language. This course is designed for students majoring in computer information systems and computer science professionals who want to update their programming skills.

## Student learning outcomes
- Apply algorithmic and mathematical reasoning to solve a wide range of computational problems.  
- Analyze and evaluate alternative solutions to computing problems using a programming language.
- Use current tools in computing practice such as Integrated Development Environments and Code Sharing platforms.

Some assignments may require more time to complete than others. It's your responsibility to allocate the time needed to finish your work. 
Be sure to begin your work before the due date. The late work is deducted 25% when submitted within 24 hours past the due date. 
Any work submitted past 24 hours of the due date will be graded 0.

## Attendance/Absences
**Please note that regularly logging into the course is mandatory to avoid dropping or withdrawing from the course**.
-  It is the student’s responsibility to drop all classes in which they are no longer participating/attending.
-  It is the instructor’s discretion to withdraw a student after the add/drop deadline due to excessive absences.
- __(For online classes):__ Students who have not logged into the course for three days before the add/drop deadline will be dropped for non-attendance. 
- __(For inperson classes):__ The instructor will drop the student if a student is absent in the first two weeks.
- Students who remain enrolled in a class beyond the published withdrawal deadline, as stated in the class schedule, will receive an evaluative letter grade in this class. (A, B, C, D, F, P, NP)

## Accommodating Students with Disabilities
Students with disabilities who may need academic accommodations should contact me as soon as possible.  You and I will work with the Disability Support Programs and Services (DSPS) department to identify your appropriate academic accommodations for this course. 

> DSPS is located in the K1 Student Services building, room K1-204 and can be reached at (619) 388-7312 or by email at miradsps@sdccd.edu. To register or to learn more about their services, please visit their website at www.sdmiramar.edu/dsps

## Undocumented & Immigrant Student Services

Undocumented and immigrant students are welcome in this class. As an educator, I strive to be an ally and provide a safe learning environment for you regardless of your immigration status. Your legal status should not be an obstacle to you in my classroom or to your educational success.
The Miramar Dreamers Support Office provides programs and services to undocumented and immigrant students. The Dreamers staff can meet with you for one-on-one support sessions, connect you to financial aid and scholarship resources, provide information about how to earn money, and host weekly engagement activities. Every student who needs one gets a FREE immigration-related legal consultation with our partners at the Higher Education Legal Services, too!

> Visit the Dreamers Support Office in the Student Services Building, room K1-304 (third floor), or online at <https://sdmiramar.edu/services/dreamers>. Schedule an appointment at <https://bit.ly/dreamerappt>.

## Cheating/Plagiarism
Students are expected to be honest and ethical at all times in the pursuit of academic goals. Students who are found to be in violation of Administrative Procedure 3100.3 Honest Academic Conduct, will receive a grade of zero on the assignment, quiz, or exam in question and may be referred for disciplinary action in accordance with Administrative Procedure 5520, Student Disciplinary Procedures.

## Honest Academic Conduct

Students are expected to adhere to the Honest Academic Conduct policy at all times. Students who violate the Honest Academic Conduct policy may be removed from class by the faculty for the class meeting in which the behavior occurred and the next class meeting.
- For online classes: Student access to class is removed for one week (5 instructional days).

No make-up work will be accepted during the removal.

> The Honest Academic Conduct policy can be found in Board of Trustees Policy, BP 5500, Student Rights, Responsibilities, Campus Safety and Administrative Due Process posted on the District website at:
<https://www.sdccd.edu/docs/District/procedures/Student%20Services/AP%203100_03.pdf>

## Sustainability
Miramar College is committed to sustainability in our classrooms and on campus. To minimize paper use, please consider whether a document can be shared digitally rather than printed. When a document must be printed, decrease margins to 0.8” and print on both sides of the paper.  
 
You are encouraged to bring reusable drink containers to school (and fill them at the water dispensers located around campus). For single-use packaging, please use the recycle bins for plastics, paper, cans, and cardboard.  
 
Thank you for doing your part to conserve resources in your academic life and keeping our campus environment clean.
